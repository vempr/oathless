### The dungeon

- Monsters: five classes of monsters, melee only

Difficulty change explained: although the dungeon's difficulty gradually progresses the deeper you go, this isn't the case for the beginning of the game. Nova's old guild had been making so much commotion above that the strongest monsters decided to venture up and face them, while the weaker ones were tasked with patroling the bottom floors. Hence at the end of the game, Nova & Ember face the most challenging enemies.

## Storyline

### The betrayal and Nova's death

Mira proposes the thought of cutting Nova from the team. Valen understands Mira's reasoning:

- Nova is objectively the most useless guild member, he's only good for providing team support in rare cases
- One less person to worry about, less people holding potential back -> better long-term success
- His death will intimidate the rest of the guild (Nyx and Lyssa), increasing overall guild productivity out of fear

Valen prepares to kill Nova by announcing another dungeon adventure. Inside, there is a long staircase with many floors, the most bottom floor being the one with the deadliest enemies. He has already discussed his plan with Nyx and Lyssa, who show no sign of objection. Nyx agress with Valen's idea: Nyx will throw Nova down the staircase.

On the deciding day, Valen orders Nova to clear the first floors to tire him out. While he rests after battle, Nyx punches him from behind and drags his unconscious body to the staircase. He already wanted to throw him into the abyss but before that, Valen wakes Nova up. Nova calls for help: Lyssa and Mira do not answer. Before dropping him, Valen explains why this is happening and that Nova isn't part of the guild anymore.

### At the bottom of the dungeon

Nova's glass body had shattered. He quickly regained his consciousness and spotted nearby enemies that are coming for him. Nova stood up and held the first enemies off, but his body was falling apart and he was losing mana quickly. He ran off to a corner, accepting his death and wept, as his body gave up on him. Before his eyes shut off, a warm light emerged with a calming voice. "This must be heaven calling for me"

### Waking up after thinking he had died

He had woken up, surprised that he wasn't in the afterworld yet. Nova recognized the place immediately and concluded that he was somewhere in a dungeon floor, but the place felt so safe and rediated a comforting energy. He sat up and looked at his body: the shattered body parts had been filled with something to heal him and regenerate the glass.

Ember later comes back from a short expedition. She brought back food and more healing resources with her injured crystal body. Nova is curious as to why she decided help him. Her reasoning: she saved him so he could help her escape the dungeon. The statement triggered his trauma.

### Halfway into the game

In an encounter, Ember acted recklessly and hurt herself badly: she thought Nova would have abandoned her to die like her guild did in the past. She argues with Nova about how he would put himself at risk trying to keep her alive, yet he doesn't listen and fights against all odds.

### The finale

After defeating the final enemies of the dungeon, Nova and Ember climb the stairwell. They are exhausted from combat and can't wait to finally rest. Taking the usual break after every few floors, Nova goes to gather water. By the time he gets back, he sees her stuff scattered on the floor. Ember was being beaten up by Nyx and Mira. Valen spots Nova and orders Mira to help him kill Nova.	

After some dialog and killing Mira & Valen, he rushes over to Ember. She has kept running away from Nyx until a few moments ago, when she got too tired and faced him. Before the lethal strike landed on Ember, Nora thrusted his sword with all of his power into Nyx. All that was left on the battlefield were three dead traitors and a heavily crippled pair. Despite their best efforts to climb the rest of the floors, their bodies eventually gave up. The physical stress from clearing the entire dungeon and finishing off old business was starting to show: It was clear that they were dying soon. Nova hopelessly pushed through, but Ember held on to him. She didn't want their last moments to be them walking towards their deaths, so they had a heartfelt pre-death conversation. Nyx had damaged Ember's body so much, so she became the first to fall; without the warmth of Ember, Nora felt his life slowly coming to an end.

In the span of a few days, he learnt a lot about his world. How everything was meant for nothing, how his efforts were all discarded. But when it was meant to be over, when everything was against his odds, a kind soul saved him. He made many mistakes. He relied on his teammates too much, and they knew how to exploit his trust. But he didn't regret any of that. He didn't regret teaming up with them and working for those twisted people. His only regret was failing to protect the one who saved him, even if it meant sacrificing his life. He couldn't protect her, who showed him true kindness. Who showed him how to be strong again. Who showed him what it meant to love someone. Her warmth had disappeared long ago, he didn't fear death anymore: there was nothing to hold on anymore. He hoped to join her in the afterlife, if there was ever one. 
 
### The epilogue

His eyes opened once again. "I must have died." But he looked around and saw Lyssa, having a conversation with Ember. The crystals had disappeared, instead her body was wrapped in vines and flowers. It looked like the plants were holding her mana intact. He took a glance at his own body and sure enough, he was also covered in the same kind of vines and flowers. Under the greenery, he recognized his broken body. Every particle of his glass body was shattered, only being held together by Lyssa's magic.

Lyssa teached Nora and Ember her own magic, so they could heal themselves in the future. Life magic was so detrimental for her body that she would definitely die if she wanted to use it again, however that was the only thing she could do to thank Nora for freeing her from the guild. She had quit being an adventurer after finding out about the deaths of every other guild member, and is now teaching at an academy.

Nora and Ember are still healing, psychologically and physiologically. But they no longer face the world alone. What the future holds is unknown, and perhaps it doesn't need to be decided. For now, they have each other, and that is enough.
