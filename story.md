### The dungeon

- let's categorize them:
	- shardeaters
	- typical tank class
	- sneaky class, assassin type
	- aggressive class, force Ember and Nora to fight groups together
	- elite class

Difficulty change explained: although the dungeon's difficulty gradually progresses the deeper you go, this isn't the case for the beginning of the game. Nova's old guild had been making so much commotion above that the strongest monsters decided to venture up and face them, while the weaker ones were tasked with patroling the bottom floors. Hence at the end of the game, Nova & Ember face the most challenging enemies.

## Storyline

### The betrayal and Nova's death

Mira proposes the thought of cutting Nova from the team. Valen understands Mira's reasoning:

- Nova is objectively the most useless guild member, he's only good for providing team support in rare cases
- One less person to worry about, less people holding potential back -> better long-term success
- His death will intimidate the rest of the guild (Nyx and Lyssa), increasing overall guild productivity out of fear

Valen prepares to kill Nova by announcing another dungeon adventure. Inside, there is a long staircase with many floors, the most bottom floor being the one with the deadliest enemies. He has already discussed his plan with Nyx and Lyssa, who show no sign of objection. Nyx agress with Valen's idea: Nyx will throw Nova down the staircase.

On the deciding day, Valen orders Nova to clear the first floors to tire him out. While he rests after battle, Nyx punches him from behind and drags his unconscious body to the staircase. He already wanted to throw him into the abyss but before that, Valen wakes Nova up. Nova calls for help: Lyssa and Mira do not answer. Before dropping him, Valen explains why this is happening and that Nova isn't part of the guild anymore.

### At the bottom of the dungeon

Nova's glass body had shattered. He quickly regained his consciousness and spotted nearby enemies that are coming for him. Nova stood up and held the first enemies off, but his body was falling apart and he was losing mana quickly. He ran off to a corner, accepting his death and wept, as his body gave up on him. Before his eyes shut off, a warm light emerged with a calming voice. "This must be heaven calling for me"

### Waking up after thinking he had died

He had woken up, surprised that he wasn't in the afterworld yet. Nova recognized the place immediately and concluded that he was somewhere in a dungeon floor, but the place felt so safe and rediated a comforting energy. He sat up and looked at his body: the shattered body parts had been filled with something to heal him and regenerate the glass.

Ember later comes back from a short expedition. She brought back food and more healing resources with her injured crystal body. Nova is curious as to why she decided help him. Her reasoning: she saved him so he could help her escape the dungeon. The statement triggered his trauma.

### Halfway into the game

In an encounter, Ember acted recklessly and hurt herself badly: she thought Nova would have abandoned her to die like her guild did in the past. She argues with Nova about how he would put himself at risk trying to keep her alive, yet he doesn't listen and fights against all odds.

### The finale

After defeating the final enemies of the dungeon, Nova and Ember climb the stairwell. They are exhausted from combat and can't wait to finally rest. Taking the usual break after every few floors, Nova goes to gather water. By the time he gets back, he sees her stuff scattered on the floor. Ember was being beaten up by Nyx and Mira. Valen spots Nova and orders Mira to help him kill Nova.	

After some dialog and killing Mira & Valen, he rushes over to Ember. She has kept running away from Nyx until a few moments ago, when she got too tired and faced him. Before the lethal strike landed on Ember, Nora thrusted his sword with all of his power into Nyx. All that was left on the battlefield were three dead traitors and a heavily crippled pair. Despite their best efforts to climb the rest of the floors, their bodies eventually gave up. The physical stress from clearing the entire dungeon and finishing off old business was starting to show: It was clear that they were dying soon. Nova hopelessly pushed through, but Ember held on to him. She didn't want their last moments to be them walking towards their deaths, so they had a heartfelt pre-death conversation. Nyx had damaged Ember's body so much, so she became the first to fall; without the warmth of Ember, Nora felt his life slowly coming to an end.

In the span of a few days, he learnt a lot about his world. How everything was meant for nothing, how his efforts were all discarded. But when it was meant to be over, when everything was against his odds, a kind soul saved him. He made many mistakes. He relied on his teammates too much, and they knew how to exploit his trust. But he didn't regret any of that. He didn't regret teaming up with them and working for those twisted people. His only regret was failing to protect the one who saved him, even if it meant sacrificing his life. He couldn't protect her, who showed him true kindness. Who showed him how to be strong again. Who showed him what it meant to love someone. Her warmth had disappeared long ago, he didn't fear death anymore: there was nothing to hold on anymore. He hoped to join her in the afterlife, if there was ever one. 
 
### The epilogue

His eyes opened once again. "I must have died." But he looked around and saw Lyssa, having a conversation with Ember. The crystals had disappeared, instead her body was wrapped in vines and flowers. It looked like the plants were holding her mana intact. He took a glance at his own body and sure enough, he was also covered in the same kind of vines and flowers. Under the greenery, he recognized his broken body. Every particle of his glass body was shattered, only being held together by Lyssa's magic.

Lyssa teached Nora and Ember her own magic, so they could heal themselves in the future. Life magic was so detrimental for her body that she would definitely die if she wanted to use it again, however that was the only thing she could do to thank Nora for freeing her from the guild. She had quit being an adventurer after finding out about the deaths of every other guild member, and is now teaching at an academy.

Nora and Ember are still healing, psychologically and physiologically. But they no longer face the world alone. What the future holds is unknown, and perhaps it doesn't need to be decided. For now, they have each other, and that is enough. 

## Dialogues

### Introduction

You: Morning everyone.

Lyssa: *Hi Nora! I made breakfast for everyone, so eat up.*

You: Thanks Lyssa... so... where's everyone's plates?

Lyssa: *Ah, no need to worry, we all ate already.*

Nyx: Yeah, the food was really good.

You: Really? I'm usually the first to wake up out of all you lazy bastards.

Mira: We just so happened to wake up really fricking early today, stop being so paranoid man. Your plate's already cold.

Valen: She's right, Nora. We have a really cool dungeon to clear today, so you should be thankful that Lyssa saved some food for ya.

You: Already everyone, I got it. And thank you Lyssa, I really do appreciate your cooking.

Lyssa: No worries.

Valen: We'll head out first. Let's meet up at the dungeon entry.

You: Sure, see everyone soon.

### Entering the dungeon

Nyx: Yo Nora! Over here.

Mira: About time man. Here's your own map, I marked the areas you gotta clear today.

You: Woah, this seems like a giant dungeon. You sure it's a good idea to spread out like this?

Valen: Mhm. The monsters on the first floors are harmless to us, so it only makes sense that we try to cover as much area as possible to speed things up. Here are some rations whenever you wanna take a break, we'll probably skip out on lunch today. It's only a matter of time before other people steal our loot.

Nyx: Aw man, this sucks.

You: Tough day today, ay? Got it chief.

Mira: Just come back to the house once you're done, okay everyone?

Lyssa: *Yes.*

### While resting

You: So many rooms.. it feels dumb to not skip the easy floors and go straight for gold. What does Valen need from these novice areas anyway?

You: Everyone felt out of it today. I could tell something happened, it feels tense. Let's try to talk with someone about it after I'm done for today.

// Nyx punches you from behind.

### Pre-fall

Valen: There we go, let him wake up first, Nyx. Control yourself.

You: What happened. (cough) Nyx? Let (cough) me go (cough).

Nyx: Nah man, gotta listen to the boss.

You: Va. (cough) len?

Valen: It was bound to happen, Nora. How can you expect to stay in our guild, when you're utterly useless? Did you never notice that we don't need your help inside and outside of the dungeons? It's simple: our team is complete. We don't need you.

You: So just kick me out (cough) and leave me (cough) alone.

Mira: I'm afraid we can't do that, Nora. You see, this is the perfect opportunity to show everyone what happens when you become useless. Nora, you have become useless to us. And this is your punishment. Right, Lyssa? Right, Nyx?

You: You sick fucks.

// Nyx tightens his grip on your throat.

You: (cough) (gasp for air)

Valen: It doesn't matter if you think this is twisted. The only thing that matters is winning, and you are holding us back. You can't do anything special, Nora. You don't have anything we need. We have everything.

You: MIRA! LY(cough)SSA! HELP m*e*

Valen: Drop him.

### Fall (monologue)

You: So this is it. All those dungeons. Every laugh, every promise. It was never real, was it? I trusted all of you. I guess kindness doesn't count for much. My body hurts. I can feel it breaking already. Is this fear? Or is it relief? Relieved by the fact that I now know the truth.

You: I really thought my life would end happily, alongside them. Why, fate? Why have you brought me hell?

You: I can see the bottom now. Or maybe, I'm already seeing things. Lyssa's smile every time she made food. My duo adventures with Nyx. Mira building so many different traps with me. Were those moments lies too?

You: Please make it painless, God.

### Post-fall

You: ..Where am.. I..

// scene of monsters approaching

You: ..No.. I won't go out like this..

You: ....tired .... so tired. This corner, this is far enough. this is... my spot.

// Ember

You: ..ah... this light is so peaceful.. the pain is over.. my life... is..

### Recovery

You: mm... mm.. Hah! (sits up quickly) Ouch, ouch..

You: Why.. why am I still in this dungeon? It should've been all over at this point.

You: Someone saved me. I recognize this ointment, it was teached to me in the academy. It can also heal glass wounds if a certain type of magic is casted while applying it.

// Footsteps

?: Ah, you're still alive. Your mana was spilling out really fast when I found you.

You: Hello, uh, my savior. Thank you so much for helping someone you don't even know.

?: Don't mention it. Here, some water.

You: Thanks, again. ... I have to ask this, why did you save me? I mean, I was basically dead at that point.

?: Isn't it obvious?

You: What?

?: You have to help me now. Judging by your mana, you probably feel indebted to me after I just saved your life. I feel like this is a fair trade.

You: Uhm. Yes.

?: Hm? Do you perhaps want to die again?

You: N-no. It's just, well, feels like I'm being used again. But of course, this time is different, since you genuinely helped me. Sorry, I'm still pretty shocked from everything that's happened lately.

?: ..hehe.

You: ?.. is there something on my face?

?: I won't use you, kind soul. I can guarantee that. But this doesn't mean anything, okay? We'll be even again after you bring me out of this hell.

You: You.. are the best. Yes, we'll be even after getting out.

?: Glad you understand.

You: Yeah. My name's Nora by the way.

Ember: Nora. Nice to meet you, Nora. I'm Ember.

You: Thank you, Ember.

### Some misc. conversations

// Convo 1: random campfire. Nora using leather to polish a scratch

Ember: You're obsessed with polishing scratches, Nora.

Nora: My mentor back at the academy used to say that a clear body leads to a clear mind. If I let the scratches build up, they'll block the light from emitting my mana.

Nora: That crack looks deep, Ember.

Ember: It's an old one from before I found you. I was arrogant, and look what that got me.

Nora: You tried to clear everything by yourself?

Ember: I thought I was better than them. I thought I was the only one doing the work anyways, so why not go deeper into the dungeons? After that disaster, I stumbled over you after spending weeks hiding in the dirt, waiting for my mana to run out. My pride got me stuck down here, but seeing your glass body almost crumbling.. that's what actually saved me.

Nora: Crazy to think about it. We're really lucky that I had some of my ointment left to use after your heroic scene. Also you're much nicer to be around whenever you're honest like you are right now, Ember.

Ember: Oh, shut up.

Nora: I'm being serious. Doesn't mean that the usual you is worse or anything. I like you for how you are.

Ember: ...

// Convo 2: random area resting

Ember: You're staring again, Nora. It's creepy.

Nora: Sorry. I was just thinking.. your crystals, they don't just hold mana. They bend the light. Even down here in the dark, you're really radiant.

Ember: It's a tactical disadvantage. Harder to hide from things that want to eat me when I'm a walking light bulb. My old guild used to make me scout ahead for that reason. I was the bait.

Nora: I don't see bait. I see someone who's survived situations that would've broken me in seconds.

Ember: Yea, and you were quite literally broken, Nora. I spent three days picking glass shards out of the dirt just to keep your mana form leaking into the soil. Don't act like I'm the one who's *radiant* just because I survived.

Nora: Maybe. But if I'm just a trade for your escape, why spend three days on a pile of glass?

Ember: Because leaving you there felt like leaving myself. And I'm tired of things behind left behind. Now shuddup and eat. I'm not fixing you a second time if you get a crack in your head from daydreaming.

Nora: Alright. Thanks, Ember.

### Halfway into the game

Ember: Leave it, Nora. We need to keep moving before the scent of my mana attracts more of the enemies.

Nora: No, Ember. I'm not leaving a big wound like that open. Stay still, I have some of the ointment left.

Ember: (pulling away) Stop! Why are you wasting resources? If I'm cracked, I'm slower. If I'm slower, we both die. Just.. go. Please. It's how this works. Plus, you're one bad fall away from death.

Nora: That's how they treated you in your old guild. I won't leave you, not again.

Ember: (sigh).. you're going to get yourself.. killed trying to be a hero, dummy. And I'm going to have to watch it happen.

Nora: Then don't watch. Help me stand up so we can get out of here together.

// Silence between the two injured. Their bond deepens.

### The finale

Valen: Look at that, everyone. The ghost has returned. Honestly, Nora. I'm almost offended. You were supposed to be the easy part of the plan.

Nora: Get your hands off her, Nyx. Now.

Mira: Be logical. You're badly injured and she's leaking mana like a sieve. Good job, Nora. You've done the hard work of bringing an excellent mana source right to us. Just walk away. We might even let you live as a "thank you".

Valen: Nyx, finish the crystal girl. Mira, help me handle our old friend.

// For game: the more injured he got, the sharper he became

Valen: Impossible... you were.. nothing...

// After blocking Nyx's hit with his own body.

Nyx: WHY WON'T YOU DIE!?

// After the traitors have been killed by Nora.

Nora: Ember... look. We're.. we're almost there. Just... a few.. more.. steps...

Ember: Stop, Nora. Please. Just.. sit with me. My legs... they won't move anymore.

Nora: I can.. I can carry you. I promised I'd carry you out.

Ember: You already did. We're out of the dark. We're away from them. That's enough for me.

Nora: It's not fair. We fought so hard. Every floor... every monster. All of it.. for this?

Ember: It wasn't for nothing. I spent years being bait. I thought everyone was like the people we knew. But then I found a pile of broken glass in a corner... and he was the kindest soul I had ever met..

Nora: I made so many mistakes, Ember. I let them use me until I broke. I thought I was useless because I couldn't fight like Nyx or plan like Valen.

Ember: You weren't useless. You showed me how to be strong again... you were the only one who was real.

Nora: I'm sorry... i couldn't protect you until the end. I wanted us to see the sky together.

Ember: The sky is not important, Nora. This, this is what I wanted. To not be alone.

Nora: I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

Ember: I'm tired... Nora. The cracks, they're reaching my core.

Nora: It's okay. It's okay to be tired now. Just... wait for me. I'll be right behind you. Wait for me at the campfire.

Ember: *Yes... Nora...*

Nora: *I love you, Ember*
