## Storyline

### The betrayal and Nova's death

Mira proposes the thought of cutting Nova from the team. Valen understands Mira's reasoning:

- Nova is objectively the most useless guild member, he's only good for providing team support in rare cases
- One less person to worry about, less people holding potential back -> better long-term success
- His death will intimidate the rest of the guild (Nyx and Lyssa), increasing overall guild productivity out of fear

Valen prepares to kill Nova by announcing another dungeon adventure. Inside, there is a long staircase with many floors, the most bottom floor being the one with the deadliest enemies. He has already discussed his plan with Nyx and Lyssa, who show no sign of objection. Nyx agress with Valen's idea: Nyx will throw Nova down the staircase.

On the deciding day, Valen orders Nova to clear the first floors to tire him out. While he rests after battle, Nyx punches him from behind and drags his unconscious body to the staircase. He already wanted to throw him into the abyss but before that, Valen wakes Nova up. Nova calls for help: Lyssa and Mira do not answer. Before dropping him, Valen explains why this is happening and that Nova isn't part of the guild anymore.

### At the bottom of the dungeon

Nova's glass body had shattered. He quickly regained his consciousness and spotted nearby enemies that are coming for him. Nova stood up and held the first enemies off, but his body was falling apart and he was losing mana quickly. He ran off to a corner, accepting his death and wept, as his body gave up on him. Before his eyes shut off, a warm light emerged with a calming voice. "This must be heaven calling for me"

### Waking up after thinking he had died

He had woken up, surprised that he wasn't in the afterworld yet. Nova recognized the place immediately and concluded that he was somewhere in a dungeon floor.
